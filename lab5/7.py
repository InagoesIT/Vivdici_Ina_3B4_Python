# Write a function called process that receives a variable number of keyword arguments
# The function generates the first 1000 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence and
# then processes them in the following way:
# If the function receives a parameter called filters, this will be a list of
# predicates (function receiving an argument and returning True/False) and will retain from
# the generated numbers only those for which the predicates are True.
# If the function receives a parameter called limit, it will return only that amount of numbers from the sequence.
# If the function receives a parameter called offset, it will skip that number of
# entries from the beginning of the result list.
# The function will return the processed numbers.
# Example:
# def sum_digits(x):
#     return sum(map(int, str(x)))
# process(
#     filters=[lambda item: item % 2 == 0, lambda item: item == 2 or 4 <= sum_digits(item) <= 20],
#     limit=2,
#     offset=2
# ) returns [34, 144]
# Explanation:
# Fibonacci sequence will be: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610...
# Valid numbers are: 2, 8, 34, 144, 610, 2584, 10946, 832040
# After offset: 34, 144, 610, 2584, 10946, 832040
# After limit: 34, 144
